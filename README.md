# Re-examination of the paper COVID-19-and-human-nature-relationships

## Introduction
The project will involve investigating the following dataset:
The Covid-19 pandemic on human-nature interactions dataset.

The survey (dataset) consists of several parts: the respondents’ level of engagement over 15 specific activities (ordinal, selected from Vermont Statewide Comprehensive Outdoor Recreation Plan), their ratings of 13 specific benefits from or values of nature (ordinal, selected from commonly studied CES categories), and their corresponding demographics (nominal, age, gender, race, etc). 

Our research objective is to find the impacts of the Covid-19 pandemic on human-nature interactions based on the analysis of 3,204 valid data gained from online surveys over a pool of informed Vermont residents over the age of 18. We utilize the dataset published by the authors which were collected from this survey. 
 
The paper mainly uses Multinomial Logistic Regression for each of the top six popular activities among the respondents. Based on the main logistic
regression method, this paper identifies socio-demographic patterns by using the more-widely engaged-in activities. After generating six separate multinomial logistic regression, we plan to evaluate the accuracy of model fit by generating p-value, Chi-square, Pearson, and Deviance statistics. The model we used is the multinomial logistic regression, which is discussed in the second half of the STAT 3302.
